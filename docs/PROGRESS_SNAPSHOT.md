# SceneCheck — Progress Snapshot

A dated progress report on the SceneCheck project as it has evolved from
the original HW2/HW3 browser prototype into the Expo SDK 54 + TypeScript
port that's now the active codebase.

Each section below carries its own `_Last updated_` line. Sections may be
re-snapshotted independently — if a section's metrics drift between
write-time and submission, leave the date as-is.

The two source-of-truth references for "what got done" are:

- `docs/CODE_REVIEW_REPORT.md` — the audit that drove much of the migration
- `docs/TEST_PLAN.md` — current test plan and live coverage numbers
- The phased task list (16 tasks across 7 phases) reproduced in §3 below

## 1. Project structure evolution

_Last updated: 2026-05-18 (commit 325bbd4)_

| Date | Event |
|---|---|
| Pre-2026-05-15 | Single repo, no subprojects. Root holds `index.html` + `src/*.jsx` (~9,000 lines of prototype) + `tests/` (5 unit + 4 integration) + `supabase/` (12 migrations + 9 Edge Functions). |
| 2026-05-18 | Code review (`docs/CODE_REVIEW_REPORT.md`) lands. Flags 4 backend bugs, structural issues in `app.jsx` (21 useStates, 0% coverage), and stack-level deviation from the architecture doc (web prototype vs prescribed React Native + Expo). |
| 2026-05-18 → 19 | Expo migration runs end-to-end: 16 tasks across 7 phases. Active project becomes `scenecheck-expo/`. |
| 2026-05-19 | Original prototype moved into `legacy/`. Root is now: `scenecheck-expo/` + `supabase/` + `docs/` + `legacy/` + root markdown deliverables. |
| 2026-05-19 | Env-var renamed from `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (Supabase 2025 key-system update). Legacy var kept as fallback. |
| 2026-05-19 | Four logical commits land on `main` (`59d5583` backend, `b38f70b` Expo project, `3b03664` archive, `48bae88` docs). Working tree clean. |
| 2026-05-19 | Second code review (`docs/CODE_REVIEW_REPORT_2.md`) lands as commit `c0432bf`. Confirms all 7 first-review findings resolved. Flags one new navigation bug + 7 smaller post-migration issues. |
| 2026-05-19 | Second-review patch batch (8 fixes) lands as commit `325bbd4`. Navigation 404, `isHost` literal-string bug, hardcoded date, `toastIdCounter` module-scope leak, dead `x/y` coordinate roundtrip, `fmtWhen`/`fmtTime` duplication, mock data leaking into live-mode store init, and `Map` coupling to `useStore` all addressed. |

### Phase 7 backend bug-fix breakdown

| # | Bug | Fix | Files |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Profiles RLS leaked private profiles to any non-blocker | New policy `'Profile visibility respects privacy and blocks'` + `are_friends()` helper | `supabase/migrations/00014_fix_profiles_rls.sql`, `supabase/tests/rls.test.sql` |
| 2 | Edge Functions had no CORS — browser blocked every call | `CORS_HEADERS` constant + `handlePreflight()` helper; wired into all 9 functions | `supabase/functions/_shared/supabase-client.ts` + all 9 `index.ts` |
| 3 | `subscribe-to-event` had race between capacity check and insert | Atomic `subscribe_to_event_atomic()` RPC with `pg_advisory_xact_lock` | `supabase/migrations/00015_atomic_subscribe.sql`, `supabase/functions/subscribe-to-event/index.ts` |
| 4 | `send-friend-request` never invoked `dispatch-notification` (FR10.1) | Fire-and-forget `admin.functions.invoke('dispatch-notification', ...)` after friendship commits | `supabase/functions/send-friend-request/index.ts` |

## 7. Outstanding items / next steps

_Last updated: 2026-05-19 (commit 325bbd4)_

Eight bug-level findings from the second code review
(`docs/CODE_REVIEW_REPORT_2.md`) have been patched in commit `325bbd4`.
One architectural recommendation remains (item 1 below). Ordered
roughly by remaining impact.

### Resolved by the second-review patch batch (commit `325bbd4`)

- ✅ **Navigation 404** — `event/[id].tsx:249` now routes to `/attendees/${e.id}` (matches the actual route file)
- ✅ **`isHost` broken in live mode** — `event/[id].tsx:101` now compares `e.hostId` against `me.id` from the store instead of the literal string `'me'`
- ✅ **Hardcoded date** — `(tabs)/map.tsx` now uses `fmtDate(new Date())`; the `map-tab.test.tsx` assertion was relaxed to a regex tail-match
- ✅ **`toastIdCounter` module-scope leak** — moved into store state as `_toastIdCounter`; reset to 0 in both `test-utils.tsx` and the store unit test's `resetStore`
- ✅ **Mock data in live-mode store init** — `store/useStore.ts` now gates `joined`, `friends`, `outgoing/incomingRequests`, `following`, `subscribedInterests`, and `blocked` behind `isLiveBackendAvailable()`; live mode starts empty
- ✅ **Dead `x/y` coordinate roundtrip** — `SCEvent` gained optional `lat`/`lng`; `lib/api.ts:transformEventRow` populates them directly from the database row; `eventLatLng` prefers them when present, falls back to x/y for mock fixtures
- ✅ **`fmtWhen`/`fmtTime` duplication** — `lib/api.ts` now uses `isoToTime`/`isoToWhen` from `lib/date-time.ts` (the canonical formatters added in the same patch)
- ✅ **`Map` coupling to `useStore`** — both `Map.native.tsx` and `Map.web.tsx` now accept `meInterests` as a prop; `(tabs)/map.tsx` reads from the store and passes it down

### Still outstanding

1. **Route screens through `lib/api.ts` instead of importing mocks directly.** 10 of 24 screens (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`, `app/events.tsx`, `app/search.tsx`, etc.) `import { SC_EVENTS, SC_CHATS } from '@/data/mocks'` instead of calling `api.fetchEvents()`. Live mode currently has no effect on those screens until each one is refactored to use the api client. This is a multi-file architectural change rather than a bug patch.
2. **Run the pgTAP suite + add a regression test for the RLS leak** (Phase 7 ships the fix; the regression test that asserts a stranger cannot SELECT a private profile is the natural next test). Requires Docker.
3. **Deno tests for the 9 Edge Functions**, especially the 4 touched in Phase 7 (atomic-subscribe, friend-request notification dispatch, CORS, RLS). Edge Function logic currently relies on the typed shape only.
4. **Date/time pickers in `app/create-event.tsx`** — currently uses `TextInput`s with format hints; would benefit from `@react-native-community/datetimepicker`. The legacy version had a 4-step wizard with native-feeling pickers.
5. **`ConfirmDialog.tsx` / `ToastHost.tsx` direct render tests** — both at 0% line coverage. Screen tests verify the *trigger* (`showConfirm`/`showToast` writes to the store) but not the modal render. Easy 8-10 additional tests.
6. **Strengthen screen-test assertions.** Round-2 review noted that ~50% of the 135 screen tests are render-only; they smoke-test that nothing crashes but don't exercise state transitions or downstream effects. Targeted addition of interaction assertions would close meaningful coverage gaps without much new code.
7. **Set up CI** (GitHub Actions: lint + typecheck + test on push). The architecture doc prescribes this; nothing exists yet.
8. **Long-press → edit/delete on chat messages** — needs `react-native-gesture-handler` wiring on RN. Legacy did this via `onPointerDown` + a setTimeout.
9. **Account switcher (Instagram-style)** — profile tab currently shows only the personal account. Legacy had org-account swap; needs a sheet UI + store slice.
10. **Welcome onboarding tour** — legacy `SCOnboarding`. Components exist (`SCText`, `SCButton`); needs a step state machine + skippable overlay.
11. **Delete Expo template leftovers** — `themed-text.tsx`, `themed-view.tsx`, `parallax-scroll-view.tsx`, `hello-wave.tsx`, `haptic-tab.tsx`, the `ui/` directory. None imported by SceneCheck; ~7 files, ~150 lines.
12. **E2E on web via Playwright** — drive the deployed Expo Web build through sign-in → home → join → chat → leave.

## 8. Code reviews

_Last updated: 2026-05-19 (commit 325bbd4)_

| # | Date | File | Scope | Headline |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2026-05-18 | `docs/CODE_REVIEW_REPORT.md` | Pre-migration audit of the legacy prototype + Supabase backend | 4 backend bugs (RLS, CORS, race, missing notif dispatch), god-component `app.jsx`, duplicate conflict logic, stack deviation from the architecture doc — **all 7 fixed in commits `59d5583` + `b38f70b`** |
| 2 | 2026-05-19 | `docs/CODE_REVIEW_REPORT_2.md` | Post-migration delta review of the current state | All 7 first-review findings confirmed resolved. Flagged 1 new navigation bug + 7 smaller post-migration issues — **all 8 patched in commit `325bbd4`** (see §7) |

The second review is structured as a delta — every original finding has
a ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ status line with file:line citations, plus standalone
sections on the new Zustand store design, the platform-split Map
pattern, test-infrastructure quality, and architecture/requirements
adherence. The "Prioritized Recommendations" section there is the
source for items 1–3 in §7 above.

## 9. How to re-snapshot this file

If you take a fresh measurement and want to update one section, the
pattern is:

1. Run the relevant command:
   - `npm test` for the test count
   - `npm run test:coverage` for the coverage table
   - `git log -1 --format=%h` for the commit hash
   - `git diff --stat` for file/line deltas
2. Update only the affected section and its `_Last updated_` line.
3. Leave other sections alone — they keep their original date and that's
   the point of dating per-section.

If everything is being re-measured at once, you can update every
`_Last updated_` to the same date. The dates are documentation of when
the metric was captured, not when the file was edited.
